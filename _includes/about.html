            <p style="font-size:1.3em;" >I like to make stuff. It all started with making mechanisms with my LEGOs and failed attempts of fixing our clocks and vacuum cleaner(still don’t know what is going on inside clocks). When I grew older, I was lucky enough to do my middle school and high school studies in a branch of development of exceptional talents organization. For my undergraduate studies, I got into a nice college to study aerospace engineering and learned a lot about multidisciplinary projects. In that period, I had the chance to manage a team for designing and modeling of a mid-sized regional aircraft and got a lot of experience on different stages of engineering design. After that, I attended Michigan Tech to get my Master’s degree. I joined NASLab (Nonlinear and Autonomous Systems Laboratory) during my graduate study and started working on autonomous vehicles (ground, underwater, and aerial). Our team has been doing some interesting projects, two of which got lots of publicity. One was a solution for autonomous power distribution microgrids establishment and the other one was low-cost underwater glider design and development.</p>
