            <p>One of the exciting parts of my profession is to work with mechatronics systems. This can extend from machining support structures, design and manufacturing of moving mechanisms to developing drivers for sensors, programming controllers, micro-controllers, and FPGAs.</p>

            <h5>Path planning algorithm development</h5>
            <p>In this project I made a navigation module that uses the readings from a Lidar sensor to perform path planning. The navigation module evaluates the environment to see if there are any Lidar reading indicating that an obstacle is on the way if the robot directly move towards the destination which will result in collision. If there isn't any obstacle then perfect. But if there is any, then some algorithms are called to decide on the best temporary destination (I call it subgoal here) to go to before moving towards the ultimate destination. The algorithms run in real-time meaning that a different subgoal might get chosen before the robot reaches the first subgoal. The algorithm might even choose to move to a different subgoal after it has reached the first one and before moving towards the ultimate destination, and so on. The module does not consider the robot to be a dimensionless point which results in higher level of reliability for robots of different sizes.</p>

            <h5>Autonomous Mobile Microgrid</h5>
            <p>The objective of this project was to make a group of autonomous mobile robots to move to a desired area, setup all the electrical nodes (generators, renewable energy sources, converters, batteries, etc.) that was carried by robots or the ones that are available in the area. The system would make electrical connection between them and make an electrical network to provide energy to the power loads in the area without human intervention. This network doesn't need to be connected to the main power grid and can operate independently. In summary the system was designed to establish a microgrid in a remote area autonomously. For this project we had to design electrical connections to make it easy for the robots to establish electrical connections without the need for complex mechanisms, algorithms, or human operators. We then implemented all the tools on multiple robots and made a system that makes sure that all the robots can collaborate together to accomplish the mission while each robot is performing a separate task.</p>

            <h5>Automated Planning of Persistent Missions</h5>
            <p>In many robotic missions, specially the ones that involve hard to reach environments such as underwater, energy is a great concern. For example, even the high-end autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) can only operate for few hours. The operation limitation applies to many types of robots in general. The robots need to refuel or charge batteries which is a time and money consuming operation and also requires human intervention. To improve mission persistence for robots, the amount of time that they can operate independently should increase. The proposed system can drastically improve the operation time, make persistent mission for many types of robots possible, and open the door for robots that can operate and re-energize themselves completely independently. Given a map of the mission area, a developed planning software generates the optimal paths for working robots and service robots and also the optimal location for stationary charger. A mission performed in this manner has much better energy efficiency and makes it possible to perform robotic missions for very long periods of time. The hardware implementation of the project is in development.</p>

            <p>This project was the start of autonomous mobile microgrid project that I did later on. In this one we were still figuring out how we can use robots for energy solutions. We were experimenting with different ideas and components. Finally, we made a system comprised of two small National Instruments robots that made a small electric network without human intervention.</p>
