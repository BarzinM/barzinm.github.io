            <h4>Path planning algorithm development</h4>
            <p>In this project I made a navigation module that uses the readings from a Lidar sensor to perform path planning in highly dynamic environments. The navigation module evaluates the environment to see if there are any Lidar reading indicating that an obstacle is on the way to its target. If there isn't any obstacle then perfect. But if there is one or more obstacles, then some algorithms are called to decide on the best temporary destination (I call it subgoal here) to go to before moving towards the ultimate destination. The algorithms run repeatedly, meaning that a different subgoal might get chosen before the robot reaches the first subgoal. The algorithm might even choose to move to a different subgoal after it has reached the first one and before moving towards the ultimate destination, and so on. The path planning module is designed in a way to take the robots dimensions in consideration which results in higher level of reliability for robots of different sizes.</p>

            <h4>Autonomous Mobile Microgrid</h4>
            <p>The objective of this project was to make a group of autonomous mobile robots to move to a desired area, setup all the electrical nodes (generators, renewable energy sources, converters, batteries, etc.) that was carried by robots or the ones that are available in the area. The system would make electrical connection between these electrical nodes and make an electrical network to provide energy to the power loads in the area without human intervention. This network doesn't need to be connected to the main power grid and can operate independently (called island mode). In summary the system was designed to establish a microgrid in a remote area autonomously. For this project we had to design electrical connections to make it easy for the robots to establish electrical connections without the need for complex mechanisms, algorithms, or human operators. We then implemented all the tools on multiple robots and made a system that makes sure that all the robots can collaborate together to accomplish the mission while each robot is performing a separate task.</p>

            <h4>Automated Planning of Persistent Missions</h4>
            <p>In many robotic missions, specially the ones that involve hard to reach environments such as underwater, energy is a great concern. For example, even the high-end autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) can only operate for few hours. The operation limitation applies to many types of robots in general. The robots need to refuel or charge batteries which is a time and money consuming operation and also requires human intervention. To improve autonomous mission persistence for robots, the amount of time that they can operate independently should increase. The proposed system can drastically improve the operation time, make persistent missions for many types of robots possible, and open the door for robots that can operate and re-energize themselves completely independently. As the result of this project, given the map of a mission area, a developed planning software generates the optimal paths for working robots and service robots (the ones that recharge/refuel the working robots) and also the optimal location for stationary charger. A mission performed in this manner has much better energy efficiency and makes it possible to perform robotic missions for very long periods of time. The hardware implementation of the project is in development. Below are some of the experiments that we had with mission optimization at early stages of the project. We assume a map is given and we need to strategically place charging station(s) in the area. We take speed, battery capacity, number of chargers, number of robots, etc. into consideration to generate trajectories. If the trajectory is predefined then we generate trajectories with minimal modification. For example, the images below show a predefined lawn mower trajectory which are modified as little as possible. But, if we get to plan the trajectory completely, then everything gets interesting and that is what we are working on.</p>

We were experimenting with different ideas and components. Finally, we made a system comprised of two small National Instruments robots that made a small electric network without human intervention.</p>

            <h4>Autonomous Rough Terrain Vehicle</h4>
            <p>In this project we had a huge and heavy tracked vehicle that we wanted to make a ground robot out of. We didn't ever weight it but our guess was somewhere around 700-800 lbs. We installed electric motors, motor controller, batteries, a xPC Target machine for control, IMU, and a Lidar. It was a chance to play around with communication protocols, signal processing, and packet parsing for different sensors and modules. We aren't using the vehicle that much these days but it was very exciting to work with it back then.</p>

            <h4>State Estimation and Parameter Adaptation for Building Predictive Control</h4>
            <p>Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems consume over 60 percent of energy in buildings and over 92 percent of energy in commercial buildings. Energy-optimal operation of HVAC systems can significantly reduce building energy usage, decrease peak electrical demand, and lower building carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve this, we use a history of available information and use optimization methods to generate a mathematical model that represents the behavior of a given building's HVAC system with minimum error. After this step and having an initial model, the information from heating, cooling, ventilation, and sensing systems are gathered repeatedly and with the use of a nonlinear model-based filter (extended or unscented Kalman filter) we continuously update the coefficients in our equations, keeping them accurate as the changes happen to the building (daily changes, seasonal changes, change in behavior of occupants, someone leaves a window open, etc.).</p>
