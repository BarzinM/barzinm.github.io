# Establishing microgrids using autonomous ground vehicles

* placeholder
{:toc}

## Introduction

In recent years power systems are leaning more towards using decentralized models. In traditional centralized power systems, a failure in system results in loosing electrical energy completely. Critical systems use backup systems such as generators for staying powered on but these backup systems are temporary. In decentralized models, there are many power sources connected to each other, storage systems, and power loads. This model increases the flexibility and robustness of the grid. The same model can be used in smaller size (i.e. microgrid) which uses connection between different power nodes to establish a reliable power system. These type of microgrids can be exceptionally useful when electrical power is needed in an area with limited access to main grid such as electrical energy needed for emergency response after occurrence of a disaster. In such incident, communication towers, temporal medical units, and many more establishments require power.

## Navigation Components

### Path Planning

In this project multiple autonomous ground vehicles were programmed to connect multiple power nodes (e.g. source, load, and storage) to each other and establish a microgrid. The vehicles were equipped with range sensors to perform path planning in unknown environments without colliding with any of the obstacles or each other.

### Path Tracking

The path generated by path planning algorithm acted as a reference trajectory for another module called path tracking. Path tracking algorithm was developed based on the state space representation of dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and position feedback. The result of this algorithm was commands that were sent to actuators to move the vehicles.

## Power Components

### Wiring and Connections

The details of this system and the design process can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/131115-MagneticConnection.html).

### Converter

A power module called PEBB (power electric building block) is developed by a collaborator in electrical engineering department of Michigan Tech University. The final product will be installed on ground vehicles to provide the autonomous system with capability of connecting nodes with different power characteristics (Voltage, AC/DC, etc).
