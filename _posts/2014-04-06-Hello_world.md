# First Post!

Hello, so, here is my first post. I plan to publish posts on different topics that are intersting to me. I might write posts on different topics, like technology, business, or even cooking. Hopefully, keeping it as informal as possible. I'm going to think of each post as something that I want the 'future me' to have access to and hope others find them usefull too.

```bash
$ echo `echo SGVsbG8gV29ybGQhCg== | base64 -d` # bash
```
