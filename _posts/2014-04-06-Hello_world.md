# First Post!

So, here is my first post. I hope to keep topic of my posts flexible. Hopefully, keeping it as informal as possible. I'm going to think of each post as something that I want the 'future me' to have access to and hope others find them useful too.

```bash
$ echo `echo SGVsbG8gV29ybGQhCg== | base64 -d` # bash
```
